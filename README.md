# cf-logs-downloader
A little tool to pull/download HTTP, Cloudflare Access and Audit logs from Cloudflare and save it on local storage.

## Prerequisites
- For HTTP Logs:
	* You must have an active Cloudflare Enterprise zone in order to use Cloudflare Enterprise Log Share (ELS).
	* Make sure the zone that you want to pull logs from already has Log Retention enabled - refer to [this link](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpull/enabling-log-retention) on how to enable it.
	* Make sure your Cloudflare user account has the permission to access Zone logs (particularly, Log Share Reader role). If you are unsure about that, contact your Administrator. If you are an Administrator already, no further action is required.
- For Cloudflare Access Logs:
	* You must have an active Cloudflare Zero Trust subscription (formerly known as Cloudflare for Teams) which includes Cloudflare Access.
	* Make sure your Cloudflare user account has the permission to read Account - Access: Audit Logs. If you are unsure about that, contact your Administrator. If you are an Administrator already, no further action is required.
- For Cloudflare Audit Logs:
	* Make sure your Cloudflare user account has the permission to read Account - Account Settings. If you are unsure about that, contact your Administrator. If you are an Administrator already, no further action is required.

- You need to [create an API Token from the Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens) to allow access to logs.
- Requires root access to your local machine.
- Currently only supports Linux. Windows isn't supported yet.

## Getting started
1. Download the latest version of the binary file from the [GitHub Releases section](https://github.com/erictung1999/cf-logs-downloader/releases).
2. Unzip the file. You should see 3 files: `cf_logs_downloader`, `schema.yml` and `sampleconfig.yml`.
3. Make "cf_logs_downloader" executable - `chmod +x cf_logs_downloader`.
4. Verify the script is working by executing `./cf_logs_downloader -v`. You should see this:

	```
	Version 2.8.1
	```

10. `log_dest` (list, optional) - Specify this to further configure the settings for the destination of the logs. This includes multiple options as shown below:
	*  `name` (string, required) - Give a unique name of the log destination configuration. Useful to identify in activity log.
	* `path` (string, required) - Specify the path to store logs. By default, it will save to /var/log/cf_logs/
	* `prefix` (string, required) - Specify the prefix name of the logfile being stored on local storage. By default, the file name will begins with cf_logs.
	* `no_organize` (boolean, required) - Instruct the program to store raw logs as is, without organizing them into date and time folder. Acceptable values: `true` or `false`.
	* `no_gzip` (boolean, required) - Do not compress the raw logs. Acceptable values: `true` or `false`.
11. `fields.exclude` (list, optional) - Specify the list of fields you want to exclude from logpull. Only applicable for "http" log type. You can execute `./cf-logs-downloader --available-fields` to retrieve the list of fields which are available to logpull.

You may refer to schema.yml for more information.

Here's the sample of the configuration settings:
```
type: http
# cf_account_id: your_account_id_here
cf_zone_id: your_zone_id_here
cf_token: your_token_here
rate: 0.5
interval: 30
nice: -10
debug: true
log_dest:
  - name: first_dest
    path: /var/log/first_path
    prefix: number_one
    no_organize: false
    no_gzip: true
  - name: second_dest
    path: /var/log/second_path
    prefix: number_two
    no_organize: true
    no_gzip: false
fields.exclude:
  - ZoneID
  - WAFProfile
```

## Environment variables
Here are some environment variables that you can create while using this tool:
1. `CF_LOG_TYPE` - Specify the log type. 
2. `CF_ZONE_ID` - Specify the Cloudflare Zone ID. 
3. `CF_ACCOUNT_ID` - Specify the Cloudflare Account ID. 
4. `CF_TOKEN` - Specify the Cloudflare API Token. 

## Precedence of configuration options
Usually command line arguments will take the highest priority among the others. However, depends on the settings, some of them might have different order of precedence:
1. **For Log Type, Cloudflare Zone ID, Account ID and API Token:** command line arguments - environment variable - configuration file
2. **For sample rate, logpull interval and niceness:** command line arguments - configuration file - default value
3. **For debug option**: the option will be turned on when the user specifies it either as command line arguments or inside the configuration file.
4. **For log path and log file name prefix**: specifying this option as command line arguments will override everything specified under `log_dest` inside the configuration file.
5.  **For no organize and no gzip**: specifying this option as command line arguments will override `no_gzip` and `no_organize` option in each item under `log_dest` inside the configuration file.


## Example usage
1. At a bare minimum, you must specify the log type, Cloudflare Zone ID (for HTTP log type), Cloudflare Account ID (for Cloudflare Access / Audit log type) and API Token while using the tool. By doing so, this tool will use default values for the below configurations:

	a. For HTTP log type: 
	* Log sampling rate: 100% (represented by 1 in Cloudflare Logpull API)
	* Logpull interval: 60 seconds
	* Logpull storage path: `/var/log/cf_logs/`
	* Log filename prefix: `cf_logs`
	* Enable folder organize by date and time
	* Enable Gzip compression
	* Niceness: -10
	* No debugging

	b. For Cloudflare Access / Audit log type:
	* Logpull interval: 60 seconds
	* Logpull storage path: `/var/log/cf_logs/`
	* Log filename prefix: `cf_logs`
	* Enable folder organize by date and time
	* Enable Gzip compression
	* Niceness: -10
	* No debugging

2. To use the default configurations, you can use this command for logpull: 

	a. For HTTP log type:

	```
	$ sudo ./cf_logs_downloader.py --type http -z YOUR_ZONE_ID -t YOUR_API_TOKEN
	```
	b. For Cloudflare Access log type:

	```
	$ sudo ./cf_logs_downloader.py --type access -a YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID -t YOUR_API_TOKEN
	```
	c. For Cloudflare Audit log type:
		
    ```
	$ sudo ./cf_logs_downloader.py --type audit -a YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID -t YOUR_API_TOKEN
	```
	
	Or, if you wish to use the environment variable to specify Cloudflare Zone ID and API Token, just export the environment variable with the value assigned to it (take HTTP log type as example):

	```
	$ sudo su
	# export CF_LOG_TYPE=http
	# export CF_ZONE_ID=YOUR_ZONE_ID
	# export CF_TOKEN=YOUR_API_TOKEN
	# ./cf_logs_downloader.py
	```
	
	Expected outcome: your logs will be stored in `/var/log/cf_logs/1970-01-01/1800/cf_logs_1970-01-01T18:00:00Z~1970-01-01T18:01:00Z.json.gz` initially. Subsequent logs will be stored in their respective folder based on date and time.

3. To pull HTTP logs with 10% sampling rate and 10 seconds of interval:

	```
	$ sudo ./cf_logs_downloader.py --type http -z YOUR_ZONE_ID -t YOUR_API_TOKEN -r 0.1 -i 10
	```
	
	Expected outcome: your logs will be stored in `/var/log/cf_logs/1970-01-01/1800/cf_logs_1970-01-01T18:00:00Z~1970-01-01T18:00:10Z.json.gz` initially. Subsequent logs will be stored in their respective folder based on date and time.

4. To instruct the tool not to save Cloudflare Access logs in compressed (gzip) format, and store the logs in a different folder:

	```
	$ sudo ./cf_logs_downloader.py --type access -a YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID -t YOUR_API_TOKEN --no-gzip --path /root/Downloads/my_cloudflare_log/
	```

	Expected outcome: your logs will be stored in `/root/Downloads/my_cloudflare_log/1970-01-01/1800/cf_logs_1970-01-01T18:00:00Z~1970-01-01T18:01:00Z.json` initially. Subsequent logs will be stored in their respective folder based on date and time.

5. To pull HTTP logs at 2 minutes of interval, and instruct the tool not to organize the logs in date/time folder and use a different prefix for the log filename:

	```
	$ sudo ./cf_logs_downloader.py --type http -z YOUR_ZONE_ID -t YOUR_API_TOKEN -i 120 --no-organize --prefix my_site_log
	```

	Expected outcome: your logs will be stored in `/var/log/cf_logs/my_site_log_1970-01-01T18:00:00Z~1970-01-01T18:02:00Z.json.gz` initially. Subsequent logs will be stored in their respective folder based on date and time.

6. To pull Cloudflare Access logs for just one time (without scheduling) and without organizing the log file into date/time folder:

	```
	$ sudo ./cf_logs_downloader.py --type access -a YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID -t YOUR_API_TOKEN --one-time --no-organize --start-time 2021-02-02T18:00:00Z --end-time 2021-02-02T18:30:00Z
	```

	Expected outcome: your log will be stored in `/var/log/cf_logs/cf_logs_2021-02-02T18:00:00Z~2021-02-02T18:29:59Z.json.gz`. Note that this tool will deduct 1 second from the end date specified.

7. To pull HTTP logs with 50% sampling rate, 30 seconds of interval, store them in a different folder with different log filename prefix, without gzip compression and do not organize the logs into date/time folder:

	```
	$ sudo ./cf_logs_downloader.py --type http -z YOUR_ZONE_ID -t YOUR_API_TOKEN -r 0.5 -i 30 --path /home/user/cf_logging/ --prefix example_com --no-gzip --no-organize
	```

	Expected outcome: your logs will be stored in `/home/user/cf_logging/example_com_1970-01-01T18:00:00Z~1970-01-01T18:00:30Z.json` initially. Subsequent logs will be stored in their respective folder based on date and time.

8. To exclude certain log fields in logpull task (e.g. ZoneID and WAFProfile), use this command:

	```
	$ sudo ./cf_logs_downloader.py -z YOUR_ZONE_ID -t YOUR_API_TOKEN --exclude ZoneID,WAFProfile
	```

## Retrieving items in queue
1. Specifying `--list-queue` as the parameter will display the list of failed tasks waiting for retry, but without any formatting and sorting. The output will look like this:

3. Specifying `--queue-size` as the parameter will display the number of items inside the queue. Useful to know how many failed tasks pending for retry.
4. If you specify any of the parameters as listed above, all other parameters that you specified (e.g. `-z` or `-t`) will be ignored.

## Known issues
1. Currently it does not support separating queues based on Zone ID (domain). You may get unexpected behavior when you try to change the Zone ID while there are items in the queue, which is not bind to any Zone IDs.

## Notes
1. Currently only Cloudflare API Token can be used to authenticate against Cloudflare APIs. Global API key is not supported, as this is a more insecure option.
2. All the logpull activity logs will be written in `/var/log/cf_logs_downloader/` folder (can be adjusted by `SELF_LOGS_PATH` env variable). Make sure you have the appropriate permission (root) to run the script.
3. Each successful logpull activity will be written in `succ.log` file.
4. If a logpull task failed, the failed task will be put inside a queue. A separate thread will keep checking the queue for new items, and reattempt the logpull process. The thread will pick up new items after each logpull activity for every 3 seconds. If there's 3 consequtive failed logpull activities, then the thread will wait for 60 seconds before performing the next logpull activity. 
5. Some logpull tasks can't be retried because of known error (for example, requesting bot management field from a zone which does not have bot management enabled). In this case, the failed logpull activity will be written in `fail.log`.
6. If you specify `--one-time` parameter, you must specify `--start-time` and `--end-time` at the same time and vice versa.
7. For HTTP log type, the `--start-date` must be no more than 7 days earlier than now (according to [Cloudflare Developers Docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpull-api/requesting-logs)).
8. For HTTP log type, the `--end-date` must be at least 1 minute earlier than now and later than `--start-date` (according to [Cloudflare Developers Docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpull-api/requesting-logs)).
9. For HTTP log type, the maximum range between `--start-time` and `--end-time` must be 1 hour only. Otherwise, Cloudflare API calls will fail (according to [Cloudflare Developers Docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpull-api/requesting-logs)).
